# Sentiment-analysis-on-restaurant-reviews-using-naive-bayes
Now a days many customers are showing more interest in reading the reviews of restaurant. But there are thousands of reviews.So reading these many reviews within a short span of time is impossible. So I have developed a classification model which will classify the reviews as positive or negative using nltk library. 
# steps involved in building this model.
1. Importing the libraries 
2. Importing the dataset 
3. Cleaning the texts 
4. Creating the Bag of Words model 
5. Splitting the dataset into the Training set and Test set 
6. Fitting Naive Bayes to the Training set 
7. Predicting the Test set results 
8. Making the Confusion Matrix
